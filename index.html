          <div class='body'>
            <p>I worked within 'Web Data Engineering', the technical team behind the majority of <em>sun.com</em> websites. Though my initial role was to develop internal applications, in 2010, after the Oracle takeover, my responsibilities shifted and I played a key role in the maintenance of several important systems and their transitions to Oracle's infrastructure.</p>
            <p>My responsibilities included:</p>
            <ul class='last'>
              <li>Developing a monitoring system for our team and others; this involved building a set of APIs, designing a robust XML schema (using RelaxNG) and a lightweight front end powered by MooTools and GWT.</li>
              <li>Building in and around the custom CMS powering Sun's online presence.</li>
              <li>Development and support of <em>docs.sun.com</em>. Following Oracle restructuring, I was placed as the primary engineer in charge of the complex legacy application containing the entirity of Sun's product documentation. Alongside the progression of the existing system to EOL, I prototyped solutions to aid in the migration of content to Oracle's Technology Network.</li>

          <p class='dates'>December 2006 - June 2009</p>
          <div class='body'>
            <p>Working in the University's web team, my primary role was the support and development of internal websites and applications. However, my biggest contribution was to design and engineer a PHP-based content management system which is still in use today and powers hundreds of websites and over 20,000 pages.</p>
            <p class='last'>This system relied on Dreamweaver to deliver content which leveraged the existing skills of web publishers. A large part of the CMS is focused on providing publishers with a means to use complicated and dynamic features without any technical expertise. Aggressive caching of dynamic content and a good relationship with <em>nginx</em> ensured the system would hold-up under heavy load.</p>
