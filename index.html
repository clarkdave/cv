          <div class='body'>
            <p>LoyaltyLion is a social loyalty framework for e-commerce stores. We were one of ten teams selected from over 300 applicants to participate in Startupbootcamp Berlin.</p>
            <p>I head up development of our front and backend services and manage our server infrastructure on AWS. Our technology stack includes: Chef for server automation, Node.js for our API, Ruby on Rails for our web application and Backbone.js for our front-end.</p>
            <p class='last'>Aside from technical duties, I am also involved in a variety of general startup tasks, such as hiring, video editing, pitching to investors, and, of course, living on a shoestring budget.</p>

          <p class='dates'>January 2012 - September 2012</p>
          <div class='body'>
            <p>Streetvite was a platform that encouraged people to be social and spontaneous. I built a mobile web app using Backbone.js, which allowed Android and iOS users to create and join events, in addition to discovering those nearby. The application was heavily optimised for mobile devices, with offline support and high-DPI graphics.</p>
            <p class='last'>The mobile web app was coupled with a full desktop site - both backed by the same Ruby on Rails backend - which allowed promoters to create and manage their events and reward fans with discounts or free entry.</p>

          <div class='body'>
            <p>Working in the Learning and Research department my role included the support, development and optimisation of critical student support systems and the design of bespoke systems for research services.</p>
            <p>In particular, I was at the forefront of a national effort to design and implement a higher-education research standard. This involved the use of enterprise service buses, message queues, schema design and workflow engines such as Activiti.</p>
            <p class='last'>As part of these developments I introduced new tools and development practices such as Backbone.js for rapid development of responsive, client-side applications backed by server-side APIs written in Java and Groovy.</p>

          <h3>Web Engineer <span>at Sun Microsystems/Oracle</span></h3>
          <p class='dates'>July 2009 - June 2010</p>
          <div class='body'>
            <p>I worked within 'Web Data Engineering', the technical team behind the majority of <em>sun.com</em> websites. Though my initial role was to develop internal applications, in 2010, after the Oracle takeover, my responsibilities shifted and I played a key role in the maintenance of several important systems and their transitions to Oracle's infrastructure.</p>
            <p>My responsibilities included:</p>
            <ul class='last'>
              <li>Developing a monitoring system for our team and others; this involved building a set of APIs, designing a robust XML schema (using RelaxNG) and a lightweight front end powered by MooTools and GWT.</li>
              <li>Building in and around the custom CMS powering Sun's online presence.</li>
              <li>Development and support of <em>docs.sun.com</em>. Following Oracle restructuring, I was the key engineer in charge of the complex legacy application containing the entirity of Sun's product documentation. Alongside the progression of the existing system to EOL, I prototyped solutions to aid in the migration of content to Oracle's Technology Network.</li>

          <p class='dates'>December 2006 - June 2009</p>
          <div class='body'>
            <p>Working in the University's web team, my primary role was the support and development of internal websites and applications. However, my biggest contribution was to design and engineer a PHP-based content management system which is still in use today and powers hundreds of websites and over 20,000 pages.</p>
            <p class='last'>This system relied on Dreamweaver to deliver content which leveraged the existing skills of web publishers. A large part of the CMS is focused on providing publishers with a means to use complicated and dynamic features without any technical expertise. Aggressive caching of dynamic content and a good relationship with <em>nginx</em> ensured the system would hold-up under the heavy load of millions of hits each month.</p>
