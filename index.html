					<h3>Software Developer <span>at University of Kent</span></h3>
					<p class='dates'>July 2011 - Present</p>
					<div class='body'>
						<p>Working in the Learning and Research department my role has included the support, development and optimisation of critical student support systems and the design of bespoke systems for research services.</p>
						<p>In particular, I have been at the forefront of a national effort to design and implement of a higher-education research standard. This has required the use of enterprise service buses, message queues, schema design and workflow engines such as Activiti.</p>
						<p class='last'>As part of these developments I introduced new tools and development practices such as Backbone.js for rapid development of responsive, client-side applications backed by server-side APIs written in Java and Groovy.</p>

					<h3>Lead Web Developer <span>at University of Kent</span></h3>
					<p class='dates'>July 2010 - June 2011</p>
					<div class='body'>
						<p>As a lead developer at the University's web team, my responsibilities included the development of central web applications, recruitment, training and consultation.</p>
						<p>Specific activities:</p>
						<ul class='last'>
							<li>Development of a system using Node.js to facilitate conversion of older websites to a newer content management system. This system had an asynchronous UI using WebSockets to simulate a responsive desktop application.</li>
							<li>Bespoke time management software built using Java and the Play Framework. This was designed with specific requirements, used an agile methodology and applied test-driven development to ensure complete specification compliance at all times.</li>

					<h3>Web Engineer <span>at Sun Microsystems/Oracle</span></h3>
					<p class='dates'>July 2009 - June 2010</p>
					<div class='body'>
						<p>I worked within 'Web Data Engineering', the technical team behind the majority of <em>sun.com</em> websites. Though my initial role was to develop internal applications, in 2010, after the Oracle takeover, my responsibilities shifted and I played a key role in the maintenance of several important systems and their transitions to Oracle's infrastructure.</p>
						<p>My responsibilities included:</p>
						<ul class='last'>
							<li>Developing a monitoring system for our team and others; this involved building a set of APIs, designing a robust XML schema (using RelaxNG) and a lightweight front end powered by MooTools and GWT.</li>
							<li>Building in and around the custom CMS powering Sun's online presence.</li>
							<li>Development and support of <em>docs.sun.com</em>. Following Oracle restructuring, I was placed as the primary engineer in charge of the complex legacy application containing the entirity of Sun's product documentation. Alongside the progression of the existing system to EOL, I prototyped solutions to aid in the migration of content to Oracle's Technology Network.</li>
						</ul>

					<h3>Web Developer <span>at University of Kent</span></h3>
					<p class='dates'>December 2006 - June 2009</p>
					<div class='body'>
						<p>Working in the University's web team, my primary role was the support and development of internal websites and applications. However, my biggest contribution was to design and engineer a PHP-based content management system which is still in use today and powers hundreds of websites and over 20,000 pages.</p>
						<p class='last'>This system relied on Dreamweaver to deliver content which leveraged the existing skills of web publishers. A large part of the CMS is focused on providing publishers with a means to use complicated and dynamic features without any technical expertise. Aggressive caching of dynamic content and a good relationship with <em>nginx</em> ensured the system would hold-up under heavy load.</p>
